# New-to-Stats
The whole point of stathelp.org is to help beginners in statistics find their feet, and gain enough confidence to be able to do their own learning. This webpage seeks to do just that, by providing:
- A beginner's guide to doing statistics on a computer (using the programming language ```R```)
  - Download and install ```R``` (this is not an application which you "open up" like Microsoft Excel--it is installed into the nitty-gritty file system on your computer)
  - Download and install "Rstudio" (this *is* an application--you open it up and start writing ```R``` code)
  - Download a sample dataset from this webpage (a file called "diabetes.csv", similar to an Microsoft Excel file, but slightly more basic)
  - Open up RStudio
  - Write a simple R file (within the RStudio application) to "load" the sample CSV file into RStudio (so we can work with it)
  - Click "Run" and watch the diabetes.csv file load into RStudio
  - View the spreadsheet contained within diabetes.csv
  - Write three simple commands using ```R``` code
    - to print out (on the screen) the figures in the spreadsheet
    - to do some basic calculations
    - to produce a basic plot
- A series of tutorials which take you step-by-step through all the key mathematical ideas which statistics is built on
- A list of ```R``` functions commonly used for analysing data
- A systematic method for doing your own statistical analysis
