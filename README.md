# New-to-Stats
The whole point of stathelp.org is to help beginners in statistics find their feet, and gain enough confidence to be able to do their own learning. This webpage seeks to do just that, by providing:
- A beginner's guide to doing statistics on a computer (using the programming language ```R```, through an an application on your computer called "RStudio")
- A series of tutorials which take you step-by-step through all the key mathematical ideas which statistics is built on
- A list of ```R``` functions commonly used for analysing data
- A systematic method for doing your own statistical analysis
